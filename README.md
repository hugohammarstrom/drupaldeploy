#### SSH keys with passphrase (or ssh-agent support)

> This only tested with Mac/Linux

With the help of `ssh-agent`, `mup` can use SSH keys encrypted with a
passphrase.

Here's the process:

* First remove your `pem` field from the `config.json`. So, your `config.json` only has the username and host only.
* Then start a ssh agent with `eval $(ssh-agent)`
* Then add your ssh key with `ssh-add <path-to-key>`
* Then you'll asked to enter the passphrase to the key
* After that simply invoke `studiointeract` commands and they'll just work
* Once you've deployed your app kill the ssh agent with `ssh-agent -k`
